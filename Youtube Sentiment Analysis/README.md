# NLP-Project
This is our final project product for Natural Language Processing class. We chose to do sentiment analysis on Youtube comment dataset to understand how viewer preceived the a certain Youtube video. We then try to explore patterns and finally build a model that can classify whether the input is a negative, neutral or positive response.
<br><br>In the future, we would like to improve the model through:<br>
* Undersampling/oversampling on training dataset (negative, neutral, positive)
* Experiment more on linear SVM Hyperparameter tuning
